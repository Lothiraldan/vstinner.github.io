Diversity in open source communities

XXX Kraken myth

Nobody saw him, so it doesn't exist, right?

I am a 35 years old white male living in France. I am programming since I was
15 years old.  I published my source code for free even before I learnt about
libre software licenses like the GNU GPL or the MIT license. My first libre
software was the game Wormux (then recalled Warmux) made with french friends.
I learnt english when contributing to the Python programming language. I
love code: write code, read beautiful code, discuss code, etc.

On Python, I get my first conflict on design choices related to Unicode. I
was convinced that I was right but I failed to discuss with others. Once
I merged a change even if the maintainer disagreed. The maintainer asked
for a revert, so I reverted my change.

At work, I have been harassed multiple times, I didn't know how to handle it
and so I tried to ignore it. My harassers made me think that I was the source
of the harassement. I was really bad and didn't discuss my issues with anyone.
I was almost fired because of an harasser. Hopefully, things gone better after
I moved to a new team.

What is harassement? My definition is to be annoyed regularly (ex: every week,
everyday in the worst cases) for a long period of time (1 month, 6 months or
longer) by someone or a group of people.

Many people consider that harassement doesn't exist because they were never
victim themself. If none of their friend told them about harassement,
harassement doesn't exist. Basic.

The thing is that harassement victims are ashamed to talk about that. It took
me 6 months to slowly start talking with my wife that I was harassed. My wife,
not a random people.

In case of a conflit, if the maintainer is in conflict with a contributor, the
contributor doesn't complain because outsiders may only trust the maintainer
and not the young contributor.

Are libre software communities safe and welcome places? Sorry, I cannot answer
to this question. Please listen to victims. Look at post-mortem articles,
people leaving projects, etc.

Even if I admire the Linux kernel since I learnt about it 15 years ago and I
really want to contribute to it, I decided to not contribute to Linux because
I am afraid of Linus Torvalds who chose to define a "Code of Conflict" for its
project. Once a year, I read a violent email from Linus against a developer.
Most of the email complains about the author of a change, only a minor
part is related to the change itself. I cannot accept personal critisms. That's
not how I judge someone's work.

Saying that I ignore the name of a change would be a lie, but I am doing my
best to only judge the quality of a change by its change, and not pay attention
to the author name. The truth is that when I know well an author and like
their work, I only read quickly a change.
