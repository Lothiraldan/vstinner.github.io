My previous article `Daemon threads and the Python finalization in Python 3.9
<{filename}/daemon-threads-python-finalization-python32.rst>`_ introduces
issues caused by daemon threads in the Python finalization.

Here we will see new issues arisen by the work on isolating subinterpreters
done in Python 3.9.

Race condition in Python finalization
=====================================

In March 2019, I notices that ``test_threading.test_threads_join_2()`` was
killed by SIGABRT on the FreeBSD CURRENT buildbot, `bpo-36402
<https://bugs.python.org/issue36402>`_::

    Fatal Python error: Py_EndInterpreter: not the last thread

It is a race condition: the build is a success since the test passed when
re-run.

I already saw the bug in 2016 (`bpo-27791
<https://bugs.python.org/issue27791>`_, and `bpo-28084
<https://bugs.python.org/issue28084>`_ reported by Christian Heimes) on a
FreeBSD buildbot, but I closed the issue since I only saw it twice in 4 months
and I didn't have access to FreeBSD to attempt to reproduce the crash.

A similar bug, `bpo-36989 <https://bugs.python.org/issue36989>`_, was reported
on AIX in May 2019: ``test_threading.test_daemon_threads_fatal_error()``.

In June 2019, I find a reliable way to reproduce the bug: `add random sleeps
to the test <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13889/files>`_. Since it
becomes easy for me to reproduce the issue, I can analyze it more easily. I
identify a race condition in the Python finalization. I also understand that
the bug is not specific to subinterpreters:

    The test shows the bug using subinterpreters (Py_EndInterpreter), but the
    bug also exists in Py_Finalize() which hash the same race condition.

I write a patch for Py_Finalize() to help me to reproduce the bug without
subinterpreters::

    +    if (tstate != interp->tstate_head || tstate->next != NULL) {
    +        Py_FatalError("Py_EndInterpreter: not the last thread");
    +    }

I fix the race condition in ``threading._shutdown()``::

    commit 468e5fec8a2f534f1685d59da3ca4fad425c38dd
    Author: Victor Stinner <vstinner@redhat.com>
    Date:   Thu Jun 13 01:30:17 2019 +0200

        bpo-36402: Fix threading._shutdown() race condition (GH-13948)

        Fix a race condition at Python shutdown when waiting for threads.
        Wait until the Python thread state of all non-daemon threads get
        deleted (join all non-daemon threads), rather than just wait until
        Python threads complete.

Note: This change introduced a regression (memory leak) which is not fixed yet:
`bpo-37788 <https://bugs.python.org/issue37788>`_.


Forbid daemon threads in subinterpreters
========================================

In June 2019, while working on `bpo-36402
<https://bugs.python.org/issue36402>`_ fix, I find a reliable way with daemon
threads to trigger a bug when a subinterpreter is finalized (even with
bpo-36402 fix)::

    Fatal Python error: Py_EndInterpreter: not the last thread

I report `bpo-37266 <https://bugs.python.org/issue37266>`_ to propose to forbid
the creation of daemon threads in subinterpreters.

Change::

    commit 066e5b1a917ec2134e8997d2cadd815724314252
    Author: Victor Stinner <vstinner@redhat.com>
    Date:   Fri Jun 14 18:55:22 2019 +0200

        bpo-37266: Daemon threads are now denied in subinterpreters (GH-14049)

        In a subinterpreter, spawning a daemon thread now raises an
        exception. Daemon threads were never supported in subinterpreters.
        Previously, the subinterpreter finalization crashed with a Pyton
        fatal error if a daemon thread was still running.

        * Add _thread._is_main_interpreter()
        * threading.Thread.start() now raises RuntimeError if the thread is a
          daemon thread and the method is called from a subinterpreter.
        * The _thread module now uses Argument Clinic for the new function.
        * Use textwrap.dedent() in test_threading.SubinterpThreadingTests

XXX::

        if self.daemon and not _is_main_interpreter():
            raise RuntimeError("daemon thread are not supported "
                               "in subinterpreters")

I commented:

    **Daemon threads must die.** That's a first step towards their death!

**Antoine Pitrou** created `bpo-39812: Avoid daemon threads in
concurrent.futures <https://bugs.python.org/issue39812>`_ as a follow-up.

In February 2020, when rebuilding Fedora Rawhide with Python 3.9, **Miro
Hronƒçok** of my team notices that my change `broke the python-jep project
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1792062>`_. I `report the bug
upstream <https://github.com/ninia/jep/issues/229>`_. The fix is to use regular
threads rather than daemon threads (`commit
<https://github.com/ninia/jep/commit/a31d461c6cacc96de68d68320eaa83e19a45d0cc>`__).


Daemon threads strike back
==========================

In March 2019, **Remy Noel** reports that a multithreaded Python application
using 20 daemon threads hangs randomly at exit with Python 3.5:

    The bug happens about once every two weeks on a script that is fired more
    than 10K times a day.

**Eric Snow** investigates.

XXX fix XXX


Second fix
==========

bpo-36475

Python 3.8::

    commit f781d202a2382731b43bade845a58d28a02e9ea1
    Author: Joannah Nanjekye <33177550+nanjekyejoannah@users.noreply.github.com>
    Date:   Mon Apr 29 04:38:45 2019 -0400

        bpo-36475: Finalize PyEval_AcquireLock() and PyEval_AcquireThread() properly (GH-12667)

        PyEval_AcquireLock() and PyEval_AcquireThread() now
        terminate the current thread if called while the interpreter is
        finalizing, making them consistent with PyEval_RestoreThread(),
        Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS, and PyGILState_Ensure().

Third fix
=========

December 2019, I report `bpo-39088 <https://bugs.python.org/issue39088>`_:
test_concurrent_futures crashed with python.core core dump on AMD64 FreeBSD
Shared 3.x.

Sometimes, test_multiprocessing_spawn does crash in PyEval_RestoreThread() on
FreeBSD with a coredump. This issue should be the root cause of bpo-39088:
"test_concurrent_futures crashed with python.core core dump on AMD64 FreeBSD
Shared 3.x", where the second comment is a test_multiprocessing_spawn failure
with "...  After:  ['python.core'] ..."

March 2019, I succeed to reproduce the bug on FreeBSD and debug it in gdb::

    (gdb) frame
    #0  0x00000000003b518c in PyEval_RestoreThread (tstate=0x801f23790) at Python/ceval.c:387
    387         _PyRuntimeState *runtime = tstate->interp->runtime;

    (gdb) p tstate->interp
    $3 = (PyInterpreterState *) 0xdddddddddddddddd

The Python thread state was freed: its memory was filled with ``0xDD`` byte
("dead byte") to detect when freed memory is read.

The problem is that Python already freed the memory of all PyThreadState
structures, whereas PyEval_RestoreThread(tstate) dereferences tstate to get the
_PyRuntimeState structure.

A daemon thread crash in ``PyEval_RestoreThread()``, while the main thread is
exiting the process after ``Py_Finalize()`` has been called.

This bug is a regression caused by my change:
`Add PyInterpreterState.runtime field
<https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/01b1cc12e7c6a3d6a3d27ba7c731687d57aae92a>`_
of `bpo-36710 <https://bugs.python.org/issue36710>`_. I replaced::

    void PyEval_RestoreThread(PyThreadState *tstate) {
        _PyRuntimeState *runtime = &_PyRuntime;
        ...
    }

with::

    void PyEval_RestoreThread(PyThreadState *tstate) {
        _PyRuntimeState *runtime = tstate->interp->runtime;
        ...
    }

I create `bpo-39877 <https://bugs.python.org/issue39877>`_ to investigate this
bug.

I write a patch (add ``sleep(1);`` at ``Py_RunMain()`` exit) and a script
(spawn daemon threads with a random sleep between 0.0 and 1.0 second) to
reproduce the bug on Linux.

Prepare fix 1::

    commit 7b3c252dc7f44d4bdc4c7c82d225ebd09c78f520
    Author: Victor Stinner <vstinner@python.org>
    Date:   Sat Mar 7 00:24:23 2020 +0100

        bpo-39877: _PyRuntimeState.finalizing becomes atomic (GH-18816)

        Convert _PyRuntimeState.finalizing field to an atomic variable:

        * Rename it to _finalizing
        * Change its type to _Py_atomic_address
        * Add _PyRuntimeState_GetFinalizing() and _PyRuntimeState_SetFinalizing()
          functions
        * Remove _Py_CURRENTLY_FINALIZING() function: replace it with testing
          directly _PyRuntimeState_GetFinalizing() value

        Convert _PyRuntimeState_GetThreadState() to static inline function.

Fix 1::

    commit eb4e2ae2b8486e8ee4249218b95d94a9f0cc513e
    Author: Victor Stinner <vstinner@python.org>
    Date:   Sun Mar 8 11:57:45 2020 +0100

        bpo-39877: Fix PyEval_RestoreThread() for daemon threads (GH-18811)

        * exit_thread_if_finalizing() does now access directly _PyRuntime
          variable, rather than using tstate->interp->runtime since tstate
          can be a dangling pointer after Py_Finalize() has been called.
        * exit_thread_if_finalizing() is now called *before* calling
          take_gil(). _PyRuntime.finalizing is an atomic variable,
          we don't need to hold the GIL to access it.
        * Add ensure_tstate_not_null() function to check that tstate is not
          NULL at runtime. Check tstate earlier. take_gil() does not longer
          check if tstate is NULL.

        Cleanup:

        * PyEval_RestoreThread() no longer saves/restores errno: it's already
          done inside take_gil().
        * PyEval_AcquireLock(), PyEval_AcquireThread(),
          PyEval_RestoreThread() and _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault() now check if
          tstate is valid with the new is_tstate_valid() function which uses
          _PyMem_IsPtrFreed().

I comment:

    Ok, it should now be fixed.

While trying to fix bpo-19466, work on PR 18848, I noticed that my commit
eb4e2ae2b8486e8ee4249218b95d94a9f0cc513e introduced a race condition :-(

The problem is that while the main thread is executing Py_FinalizeEx(), daemon
threads can be waiting in take_gil(). Py_FinalizeEx() calls
_PyRuntimeState_SetFinalizing(runtime, tstate). Later, Py_FinalizeEx() executes
arbitrary Python code in _PyImport_Cleanup(tstate) which releases the GIL to
give a chance to other threads to execute: (...)

At this point, one daemon thread manages to get the GIL: take_gil()
completes... even if runtime->finalizing is not NULL. I expected that
exit_thread_if_finalizing() would exit the thread, but
exit_thread_if_finalizing() is now called *after* take_gil().

        bpo-39877: Remove useless PyEval_InitThreads() calls (GH-18883)

        Py_Initialize() calls PyEval_InitThreads() since Python 3.7. It's no
        longer needed to call it explicitly.

        bpo-39877: Refactor take_gil() function (GH-18885)

        * Remove ceval parameter of take_gil(): get it from tstate.
        * Move exit_thread_if_finalizing() call inside take_gil(). Replace
          exit_thread_if_finalizing() with tstate_must_exit(): the caller is
          now responsible to call PyThread_exit_thread().
        * Move is_tstate_valid() assertion inside take_gil(). Remove
          is_tstate_valid(): inline code into take_gil().
        * Move gil_created() assertion inside take_gil().

        bpo-39877: take_gil() checks tstate_must_exit() twice (GH-18890)

        take_gil() now also checks tstate_must_exit() after acquiring
        the GIL: exit the thread if Py_Finalize() has been called.


Funny/not funny, bpo-36818 added a similar bug with commit
396e0a8d9dc65453cb9d53500d0a620602656cfe in June 2019: bpo-37135. I reverted
the change to fix the issue.

Hopefully, it should now be fixed and the rationale for accessing directly
_PyRuntime should now be better documented.

I comment:

    I tested (run multiple times) daemon_threads_exit.py with slow_exit.patch:
    no crash.

    I also tested (run multiple times) stress.py + sleep_at_exit.patch of
    bpo-37135: no crash.

    And I tested  asyncio_gc.py of bpo-19466: no crash neither.

    Python finalization now looks reliable. I'm not sure if it's "more"
    reliable than previously, but at least, I cannot get a crash anymore, even
    after bpo-19466 has been fixed (clear Python thread states of daemon
    threads earlier).

Cleanup::

    commit 175a704abfcb3400aaeb66d4f098d92ca7e30892
    Author: Victor Stinner <vstinner@python.org>
    Date:   Tue Mar 10 00:37:48 2020 +0100

        bpo-39877: PyGILState_Ensure() don't call PyEval_InitThreads() (GH-18891)

        PyGILState_Ensure() doesn't call PyEval_InitThreads() anymore when a
        new Python thread state is created. The GIL is created by
        Py_Initialize() since Python 3.7, it's not needed to call
        PyEval_InitThreads() explicitly.

        Add an assertion to ensure that the GIL is already created.

I comment:

    The initial issue is now fixed. I close the issue.

    take_gil() only checks if the thread must exit once the GIL is acquired.
    Maybe it would be able to exit earlier, but I took the safe approach. If we
    must exit, drop the GIL and then exit. That's basically Python 3.8
    behavior.

But I pushed two more fixes!
